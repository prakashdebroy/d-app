# Meta-Fi - Redefining Finance, one Gasless Transaction at a time

Meta-Fi is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to send Ethereum transactions with gas fees covered by a relayer. Built using React, Ethers.js, and MetaMask, it offers features like wallet connection, sending Ethereum, transaction history tracking, and the ability to copy transaction hashes to the clipboard.

## Features

- **Connect Wallet**: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to interact with the Ethereum network.
- **Send Ethereum**: Send Ethereum to any address with the gas fees paid by the relayer.
- **Copy Transaction Hash**: Copy the transaction hash to the clipboard for easy reference.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Ethers.js**: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **MetaMask**: A browser extension wallet for interacting with Ethereum and managing accounts.
- **Web3**: Framework for connecting to Ethereum nodes.
- **CSS**: Styling for the front-end user interface.
- **Clipboard API**: Used to copy transaction hashes to the clipboard.

## Future Prospects
- **Transaction History**: View the history of all sent transactions along with transaction hashes.
- **Reward System for Relayer Users:** After 5 transactions, the 6th transaction is free, encouraging frequent use and loyalty.
- **Low Gas Fees**: Minimising gas fress.
Lower transaction costs encourage more frequent use, improve accessibility, and reduce blockchain network congestion.
